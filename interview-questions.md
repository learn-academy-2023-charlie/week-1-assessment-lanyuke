<!-- # ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: 
Git is an software that use by programer to tracking code development and provide protection of the working code from being overwritten by unapproved code. Different form "git", Github is the most known platform that use git technology by programers around the world to share and work on coding project together today.

Researched answer:
"Git" is a free and open source software development tool that can work on various type of projects, it has many different fetures share with other similar tools and support any kinds of workflow. GitHub is an internet hosting service that provides software developer with version control and support continuous editing using "Git".

Your answer: Arrays is a variable that can store different data type in squarebrackets that become indexed. String is a datatype that return whatever value is inside the quotation mark. Arrays can be the same as string when using .join("") method to remove indexed data and string can be use .split("") method to become arrays with indexed data.

Researched answer: Array and string are both essential data container that store collections of data. Array are used to store sets of data and can hold any kinds of datatype also providing ways to manipulate the data for programing needs. String are used to store a collection of letters, digits and symobls to giving text value only that is not require manipulation.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: The proper pair programming techniques is to having both person focus on either giving the instructions or following instructions to create quality control of the project and by switching role they both have chance to express personal insight on how the project should be devoleping and how they can finish  the project that met the expectations. 

The role of giving instructions is the driver and the role of following the instruction is the coder. Driver focus on giving  instruction to the coder. Coder will follow the instruction and share screen and they both will pay attention to see if there is any mistake or typo in the code or if the git work flow is on point or not and sharing personal insigh with each other on the current project. 


Researched answer: Proper pair programming techniques are two prgrammers work together on code with one screen. One role is giving point of view on big picture of the project and provide the direction of process in coding is the "Navigator". One role is the one who type and test runing everything is the "Driver".
